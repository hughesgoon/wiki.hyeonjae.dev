# Components folder

This folder is meant to house components that are used across multiple versions. For components that are meant to be used in a specific version only, consider putting them directly in `/docs/` in the appropriate subfolder. [See here](/docs/README.md#Versioning) for more details.

## Global

Global components are used on many pages spanning many sections.
